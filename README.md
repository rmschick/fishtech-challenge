# CYDERES-challenge
Using Golang, I'm creating a simple API that is deployed as a serverless function on a cloud platform.


I decided to go with Serverless Framework from https://www.serverless.com/framework/ after looking through their documentation. Easy setup with AWS Lambda and start a serverless 
Go API. 
Started with: 'sls create --template aws-go-mod --path myService' which created a template directory with files that utilize Go Modules 

**Starting with the environment**

        NodeJS v16.14.0

        npm v8.5.1   

        serverless Framework Core: 3.2.1  Plugin: 6.1.0   SDK: 4.3.1
        
 **Installation**
 
         npm install
